<h1>The goal of this app is to create a platform where students can most easily access featuers that aren't easy to view in website like blackboard and others.</h1>

The goal of this is to create an easier way for students to manage their time through an intuitive learning portal interaction process, and to better facilitate collaboration and transparency between departments about ongoing research and projects.

One novel feature will be the ability to import linkedIn, or create your own profile, to add specific skills that can be searched for by other people within the institution.  This will be particularly useful when someone wants to create a  project that would benefit from collaboration with others in varying departments.  It's also important to see what types of projects are being worked on throughout the university, creating a broader understanding of what's going on.  Current projects can be filtered either by amount of discussion (each project features its own collaborator and viewer discussion boards) or by specific departments/skills/concepts (by tags) being investigated.

Another important feature will be the ability to dynamically update syallbi in a format that enables teachers to be flexible week to week.  An easy way to adjust the syllabus and link to a corresponding reading / assignment will prevent the reuploading that often happens as schedules adjust to specific classes.  This is much better for the instructors, students and process of documenting effectiveness. (quantifiable in the sense of seeing how much students are actually accomplishing as time goes on)

Assignments can be split into two tiers: 1 - weekly / bi weekly Assignments (journals/essays/labs) or 2 - monthly or greater assignments (tests/projects)
